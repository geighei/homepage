Welcome to the website of the GEIGHEI research project!

GEIGHEI is short for Gene-Environment Interplay in the Generation of Health and Education Inequalities.

GEIGHEI's purpose is to examine how Genes and the Environment (GxE) interact to generate inequalities in education and health over the life course.

This research projet exists thanks to the generous funding of [NORFACE](https://www.norface.net/)-[DIAL](https://www.norface.net/program/dial/).
