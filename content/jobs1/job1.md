#### Description

The Bristol School of Economics is seeking to appoint a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Health Economics with a start date of March 2020.
This is a post-doctoral position associated with a NORFACE-funded research project on gene-environment (GxE) interactions.
It will involve working closely with Dr. Stephanie von Hinke to explore gene-environment (GxE) interactions in the generation of health and education inequalities across the life course.
The project will combine methods from genetics and social science, testing
(i) whether children born into advantaged environments are better able to reach their genetic conditioned education potential, and
(ii) whether privileged environments protect against genetic susceptibility to risky health behaviours, such as smoking and drinking.
The successful candidate will exploit natural experiments to deal with possible endogeneity of the environment in GxE, using data such as the UK Biobank, the Estonian Biobank, Understanding Society, and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).

Candidates must have a PhD in a quantitative subject, ideally in economics, genetics, epidemiology, or a related discipline, though we are happy to consider applicants with other quantitative backgrounds.
Strong quantitative skills, and experience of using statistical software such as Stata, R, or SAS would be a major advantage.
The advert will be posted online in the next few weeks.
