# homepage

This page contains all of the scripts used to construct the website http://gene-environment.com/ 

The content folder contains the */_index.md files that create the different pages. 
Each subfolder (e.g. /content/people/_index.md) is related to a different sub-page (e.g. http://gene-environment.com/people/)

If you change the */_index.md file and then push it, the website will change *automatically* --> be aware of what you push!
